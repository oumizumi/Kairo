    "This program has undergone a major reform effective as of May 1st, 2022.",
    "Students admitted prior to Spring/Summer 2022 should be cautious with fall 2022 and winter 2023 course enrolments, as some compulsory courses were previously coded differently.",
    "If enrolled in an Honours degree, students must add a second study module (second major or a minor), possibly from another faculty. The second module will replace an equivalent number of elective course units."
